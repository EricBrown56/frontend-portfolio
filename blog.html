        <h2>AI and Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the field of software 
            engineering. From automating repetitive tasks to optimizing complex 
            algorithms, AI is revolutionizing the way software is developed and 
            maintained. I am excited to explore the intersection of AI and software 
            engineering in my upcoming projects.

            <p>
                This article discusses the debate on what AI's place will be in 
                the future when it comes to software engineering. Will AI completely 
                take over our jobs, making us obsolete? Are we doing all of this work 
                trying to learn everything for nothing?
